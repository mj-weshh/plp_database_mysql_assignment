/*
Structure of the table:

Implemented integer primary keys for StudentID and CourseID to guarantee uniqueness.
First and last names have been separated to allow for more versatile querying.
Establishing optimal limits for Major and CourseName lengths to strike a balance between space efficiency and user-friendliness.
Optimized storage efficiency by utilizing integer data types for Age and Credits.
Added a field to store the name of the course instructor.
Inserting Sample Data:

Utilized a wide range of student and course data to create realistic testing scenarios.
Added hypothetical GPA values to illustrate student academic performance.
Creating a new column for GPA:

Added a GPA column to the Students table to track academic performance.
Utilized the DECIMAL data type to accurately represent GPA values with the necessary precision and scale.
Performing table renaming and dropping operations:

Changed the name of the Students table to EnrolledStudents for better clarity.
Efficiently eliminated redundant data structures by removing the EnrolledStudents table.
These decisions are made with the expertise of someone experienced in data analysis,
ensuring that the database schema for managing student and course information within a university context is efficient and well-structured.
